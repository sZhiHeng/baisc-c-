/*
DNA is made up from 4 different bases(nucleotides), adenine(A), thymine(T), guanine(G) and
cytosine(C).This is true for plants, animals, bacteria, in fact it is true all life forms on earth that
contain DNA.
In an incredible molecular feat called transcription, your cells create molecules of messenger
RNA that mirror the sequence of nucleotides in your DNA.The RNA then creates proteins that
do the work of the cell.
Create a function called dna_to_rna, which should take as input a string which will have DNA
nucleotides(capital letter As, Cs, Gs, and Ts).There may be other characters, too; they should be
ignored by your transcribe function and disappear from the output.These might be spaces or
other characters that are not DNA nucleotides.
Then, dna_to_rna should output the messenger RNA that would be produced from that DNA
string.The correct output simply uses replacement :
• As in the input become Us in the output.
• Cs in the input become Gs in the output.
• Gs in the input become Cs in the output.
• Ts in the input become As in the output.
• any other input characters should disappear from the output altogether
Not quite working ? One common problem that can arise is that dna_to_rna needs to have an
ELSE to capture all of the non - legal characters.All non - nucleotide characters should be dropped.
Here are the tests to check :
ACGTTGCA should be transformed into UGCAACGU
ACG TGCA should be transformed into UGCACGU
GATTACA should be transformed into CUAAUGU
A 42% should be transformed into U
