/*
Your objective:  To write a program that will predict the future.  Use the main function to do the following… 
1. Prompt the user for his/her lucky number.
This number will be largely ignored by the rest of the program (it’s only for show, for the user’s sake). 
 
2. Prompt the user for which life topic he/she wants a prediction.
Based on the user's response call one of three functions. 
Suggestions are love, finance, and school, but you may 
use three of your own choosing. Use a nested if-else statement to control which function is called. 
Each function will… 
1. Call the rand function
2. Use the value generated by the rand function and modulus operator as the selector expression in a switch statement. 
3. Create a SWITCH that will print out the predictions.
4. Allow for five different predictions per function. 
Finally, prompt the user to see if they want another prediction.
Keep executing the program until the user tells you to quit.  
Make sure that you code for all possible user inputs, including wrong ones. */

use if statement as well as possible, because switch is not as good as if statement
