his/her student loan.
Ask the user to input the total amount of money owed 
in student loan debt, the annual interest rate being charged, 
and how much will be paid each month towards it. 
(HINT: You will need to handle having an annual interest rate
calculate the amount of interest to be charged monthly. Simply divide the annual by 12). 
Display a message informing the user how many months it will take until the loan is fully paid off.*/
