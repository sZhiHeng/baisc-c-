/*
Write a C++ program that calculates the average of four numbers – just like in the previous exercise –
but this time ask the user to enter which four numbers to calculate. You will have to use the cin
command to get all four numbers from the user.
Sample Output:
Enter the first number: (number1)
Enter the second number: (number2)
Enter the third number: (number3)
Enter the fourth number: (number4)
The average of these numbers is: (average)
*/

#include<iostream>

int main()
{ 
	
	double w, x, y, z;
	cout << " Enter the first number: ";
	cin >> w;
	cout << " Enter the second number: ";
	cin >> x;
	cout << " Enter the third number: ";
	cin >> y;
	cout << " Enter the fourth number: ";
	cin >> z;
	cout << " The average of these numbers is: " << (x + w + y + z) / 4 << endl;
	system("pause");
	return 0;


}
//int double string char are basic simple data type
//cin mean that you have press a number or letter (Depend on the data type) to put in the data.
