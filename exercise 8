/*Write a program using if, else if and else statements that will sort three
characters in ascending order(smallest to largest).Remember that characters
are stored in ASCII!Another way of saying this might be to put the characters
in alphabetical order, but be careful of lowercase versus uppercase values,
as well as handling special characters(those that are not letters, such as the dollar sign.) 
Ask the user to input three characters, then ultimately output the same three characters in the correct order.*/
