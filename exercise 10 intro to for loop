/*Create a program that will ask the user to enter an integer.
Write a loop that subtracts one from that user - inputted number, 
and keeps subtracting one until the number is down to zero.Here is a sample output :
Enter a number : 55
It is now 54.
It is now 53.
It is now 52.
(etcâ€¦)*/

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
#include<iomanip>
int main()
{
	int x;
	cout << "Enter a number : ";
	cin >> x;
	int i;
	for (i = x; i > 0; i--)
	{
		cout << "It is now " <<setw(2) << i << endl;
	}
	system("pause");
	return 0;
}

//you also can declear data type in the for loop
//example
//for( int i =0 ; i<3 ; i++)
//for loop create by 3 parts, each part ended by ';'
