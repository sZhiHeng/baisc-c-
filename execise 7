/*
Write a program for the IRS that will calculate income tax. You will need as input the person’s
annual salary. Display a message that says: This year you paid $_______ dollars in
tax. So your net salary after taxes are taken out is $________.
Format your output to two decimal places.
Assume that the tax brackets in the U.S. are as follows:
Salary Tax Rate
Under $12,000 6%
$12,001 – $38,000 27%
$38,001 – 55,000 33%
Over $55,000 39%
