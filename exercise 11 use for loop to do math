A person makes a deal with their boss. 
The boss says they will be paid a wage of $2 on their first day on the job, 
and then have their wage doubled every day after that.
Use a loop to figure out how much the person would make using this method on their 20th day of employment.*/
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
#include<iomanip>
int main()
{
	int wage = 2;
	int day;
	for (day = 1; day <= 20; day++)
	{
		cout << "day: " << setw(2)<< day <<"	" <<  "wage: " << setw(7) << wage << endl;
		wage *= 2;
	}
	system("pause");
	return 0;
}
