/*A car dealership has 10 salespeople. The dealership keeps track of the number of cars
sold by each salesperson each month and reports it to management. The management
then takes that data and assigns a number 1 â€“ 10 to each salesperson. The following
statement declares an array to store the number of cars sold by each salesperson (it
means that salesperson #1 sold 7 cars, salesperson #2 sold 3 cars, etc):
int cars[10] = {7, 3, 6, 0, 14, 8, 1, 2, 9, 8};
Output
1) the total number of cars sold at the entire dealership,
2) which salesperson sold the most cars (Salesperson #1, Salesperson #2, etc.), and
3) how many cars that best salesperson sold.
