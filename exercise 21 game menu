/*Use your menu game program that you have been building up all games.Add the treasure,
the Psychic, the guessing game 
to the list of choices.So now your menu looks like this:
***************************************************
Welcome!
Please choose a number from the following options :
1. Madlibs!
2. Choose your own Adventure!
3. Psychic future!
4. Find the Treasure!
5. Dice game!
6. Guessing game!
7. Exit!
****************************************************
When a user chooses a menu option, a function that plays that game is 
called.After the game is played, the menu once again shows up on the screen.
NOTE: ALL GAMES MUST BE IN FUNCTIONS!!The main program only has the menu in a loop!*/
