/*
Write a C++ program that will calculate how much of a profit an investor will make. You will need to get
the following input:
 the number of shares they purchased
 the price of the stock (per share) when they purchased it
 the price of the stock (per share) now
The formula to use:
Profit = (# of shares * Current Price) – (# of shares * Purchase Price)
Output this message to the screen:
You have made a profit of $_____ dollars since you bought _____ shares of
this stock.
Also, you must display the dollar amount formatted to two decimal places. Place this statement at the
start of your program:
cout << fixed << setprecision(2);
*/
#include<iostream>
#include<iomanip>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
	cout << fixed << setprecision(2);

	int numOfShares;
	double pricePerShare;
	double priceOfStockNow;
	double profit;
	cout << "How many shares you have: ";
	cin >> numOfShares;
	cout << "How are the price per share: ";
	cin >> pricePerShare;
	cout << "How are the price of stock now: ";
	cin >> priceOfStockNow;
	
	profit = (numOfShares*priceOfStockNow) - (numOfShares*pricePerShare);
	cout << "You have made a profit of $" << profit << " dollars since you bought " << numOfShares << " shares of this stock." << endl;
		system("pause");
		return price;
	
}


//#include<iomanip> represent header file that are manipulator
//with that header file, you can make your file looks good. 
//without that header file, you cannot use cout <<fixed<< setprecision(2)
